Real-time News Analysis with Newapi
This project is designed to provide timely insights into current news discussions surrounding Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), global AI developments, and related topics. By systematically acquiring, processing, and analyzing news articles, it aims to offer a clear, data-driven understanding of the evolving discourse in this critical technological domain.

Problem Solved:
The project addresses the challenge of monitoring and comprehending the vast and rapidly changing landscape of news coverage on AGI and AI. It solves the problem of manually sifting through numerous news sources to identify key trends, prominent themes, and significant terminology, providing an automated and efficient method for trend spotting and analysis.

Overall Objectives:
1) Real-time Data Acquisition: To develop and utilize an efficient pipeline for fetching relevant news articles from diverse sources using the NewsAPI, focusing on specific keywords related to AGI and global AI.
2) Robust Data Handling: To implement procedures for storing acquired news data in easily accessible formats (CSV and Excel) for persistence and future analysis.
3) Comprehensive Text Preprocessing: To prepare raw text data (titles and descriptions) for natural language processing by performing necessary cleaning and transformation steps.
4) Visual Insight Generation: To create intuitive visualizations, such as Word Clouds, that effectively highlight the most frequent and impactful terms within the collected news content.
5) Advanced Keyword Extraction: To employ statistical text analysis techniques, specifically CountVectorizer with custom stopwords and n-gram analysis, to accurately identify and rank significant keywords and phrases.
6) Linguistic Trend Analysis: To analyze and present the most frequent keywords, thereby offering actionable insights into the prevailing narratives and focus areas within the news about AGI and AI.
